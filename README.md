# Albemarle Broadband Authority Notes and Ideas

Iâ€™m a member of the [Albemarle County (Virginia) Broadband Authority](http://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=broadband&relpage=22100). This is a repository, mostly for [issues](issues/), where I keep track of ideas and work in the interests of improving access to broadband in Albemarle County.
