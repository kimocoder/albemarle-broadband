# Albemarle Broadband Authority Notes and Ideas

I’m a member of the [Albemarle County (Virginia) Broadband Authority](http://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=broadband&relpage=22100). This is a repository, mostly for [issues](issues/), where I keep track of ideas and work in the interests of improving access to broadband in Albemarle County.

## Sub-Projects

* [WiGLE harvester](wigle/): A script to harvest WiFi access points from [WiGLE](https://wigle.net/)’s API, including all WiGLE records for Albemarle County (as of April 16, 2019).
* [Albemarle broadband map](map/): Various GeoJSON files that, collectively, paint a picture of the state of broadband accessibility in Albemarle County.
